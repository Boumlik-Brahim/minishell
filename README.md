# Minishell

The minisheell project is a simple command-line interpreter that reads user input, interprets it, and executes the corresponding command or program. In this project, you will write a program that mimics some of the basic functionalities of the Unix shell.

# Installation:

To use this program in your projects, you must first compile it by running the following command:

`make`

This will compile the program into an executable file called minishell. You can then run the program by entering the following command:

`./minishell`

# Usage:

The minishell program reads user input from the command line and interprets it as a command or program to be executed. The program supports many of the basic shell commands, such as cd, echo, env, export, unset, pwd, and exit. It also supports redirection and piping.

To execute a command or program, simply type the command or program name and any necessary arguments on the command line, and press Enter:

`echo "Hello, World!"`

This will output "Hello, World!" to the console.

# Functionality:

The minishell program supports many of the basic shell functionalities, such as:

- Changing the current working directory with the cd command
- Displaying text to the console with the echo command
- Displaying the current working directory with the pwd command
- Setting and unsetting environment variables with the export and unset commands
- Displaying environment variables with the env command
- Exiting the shell with the exit command
- The program also supports redirection and piping, allowing you to redirect input and output and pipe the output of one command into the input of another command.

# Conclusion:

The minisheell project is a useful and practical project at 42 that will help you to gain a better understanding of how shell commands work and how to write a simple command-line interpreter. By completing this project, you will gain a deeper understanding of how to create programs that interact with the command line, and how to use basic Unix functionalities to create more complex programs.
